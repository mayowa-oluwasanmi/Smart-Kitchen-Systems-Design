REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS 

To support the use cases, we require the following: 

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
● Sensor Data: The system must seamlessly incorporate data from sensors (weight sensors, CMOS 
sensors, barcode sensors) to automate ingredient tracking and calorie logging.  
● Calorie Count: The system needs to be capable of calculating calorie count for a food item given 
its weight. It needs to be able to provide users with the total calorie content of a meal based on 
ingredients used and their respective weight.  
● Nutritional Profile: The system should be able to provide, once an item is detected, detailed 
nutritional information (i.e macronutrient profile) of a given ingredient in a meal. 
● Barcode: The system should allow users to log snacks or packaged foods using barcode, and add 
append to their meal log. 
● Log: The system needs to record the data of food weighed in a log for total daily intake count. 
● Data Processing: The system needs to have sufficient capacity to hold and process data. 
4 
● Recommendations: The system must be able to analyse the calorie count of stored ingredients, 
and make recommendations for high calorie ( > 250 kcal per 100g) and low calorie (<50 kcal per 
100g) ingredients when prompted by the user.  
● Nutritional Information: The system needs to display daily or weekly overview of their caloric 
intake, macronutrient distribution and level of adherence to given nutrition goals.  
● LCD Display: The system must have the capacity to store and process data from various sensors 
and display them on an LCD tablet for users to view nutritional information. 
● Integration with Nutritional Tracking Apps: The system must integrate seamlessly with various 
nutritional tracking applications to enable users to synchronise dietary data between the smart 
kitchen system and their preferred tracking app. 
● Pedometer Connectivity: The system must allow seamless communication between pedometers/ 
fitness trackers and the LCD tablet to facilitate the transmission of activity data.  
● Pedometer Data Synchronisation: The system must ensure that activity data from pedometers is 
synchronised with nutritional tracking features.  

NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 

● Reliability: The system must be reliable to ensure accurate counting and logging of food items 
without consistent error. 
● Usability: The system must provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface to encompass users of 
all skill sets and ability. 
● Performance: The system must provide information quickly with minimal latency to users. 
● Compatibility: The system must support interoperability and allow for integration with other 
services such as fitness trackers and nutritional databases. 
● Maintainability: The system should provide regular system updates without increased downtime 
or cost. 
● Compliance with NHS guidelines:The system will enforce a minimum daily calorie intake of 
1000 calories per user, aligning with National Health Service (NHS) guidelines.
