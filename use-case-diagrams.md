## Use Cases

### 1. Measure Food Intake

**Description:**  
The Smart Kitchen autonomously measures the weight of food items placed on counters or stovetops using load cell weight sensors. It identifies the type of food via barcode scanners for prepackaged items and CMOS sensors for fresh foods. This minimizes manual input and user effort, enabling seamless data collection integrated into daily kitchen routines.

### 2. Provide Real-Time Nutritional Feedback

**Description:**  
As ingredients are detected, the system processes the data and presents real-time nutritional information on an LCD tablet interface. This includes calorie counts, macronutrient profiles (protein, carbohydrates, fats, sodium, potassium, iron, fiber, etc.), and other relevant nutritional values per meal, helping users make informed decisions as they cook.

### 3. Synchronize with Nutrition and Fitness Apps

**Description:**  
The system aggregates nutritional intake data and syncs it with popular nutrition tracking apps and fitness trackers via WiFi. This allows users to view comprehensive dietary data, combining meals eaten at home with those tracked outside, all in one place for better overall nutritional awareness.

### 4. Recommend Low-Calorie Food Alternatives

**Description:**  
Based on the nutritional data and user goals, the Smart Kitchen suggests healthier, low-calorie food alternatives (less than 100 kcal per 100 grams). These recommendations empower users to make informed choices without enforcing decisions, following the principle of providing an “informed veto.”

### 5. Display Historical Dietary Logs

**Description:**  
Users can access past logs of daily or weekly nutritional intake through the tablet interface. This feature provides summaries of calorie and macronutrient consumption over time, supporting self-monitoring and dietary awareness.
