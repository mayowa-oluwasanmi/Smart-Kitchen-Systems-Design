# Smart Kitchen System

## Overview

The Smart Kitchen System is designed to automate the tracking of nutritional intake during meal preparation using integrated sensors and image recognition technology. The system reduces user burden by automatically measuring food quantities, scanning barcodes, and providing real-time calorie and nutrient data, displayed on an LCD tablet in the kitchen.

This system's significance lies in its improvements over previous iterations of nutrition tracking Smart Kitchens, including synchronisation with mobile tracking apps and fitness trackers, the ability to track prepackaged foods, and a recommender system for low-calorie ingredients. These upgrades provide users with better tools to make informed choices about their daily diet, leading to improved habits and overall health.

## Key Features

- Automatic ingredient tracking with weight sensors, barcode scanners, and CMOS cameras  
- Real-time nutritional data aggregation and calorie counting  
- Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) calculation using the Harris-Benedict equation, incorporating pedometer data  
- Daily and weekly nutritional summaries and recommendations  
- Integration capability with fitness trackers and nutrition apps like MyFitnessPal
